Academic studies on COVID-19 have been increasing day by day, reading each study has been a challenging process for doctors and researchers. It is useful to use important keywords in the search step in academic literature search platforms to find the right articles. However, with natural language queries, the right articles can be accessed quickly and easily. In this study; A BERT model has designed out of 150 thousand academic studies collected on COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and coronaviruses. While designing the model, academic studies have pre-processed and embedding vectors have produced. Cosine similarity method has used on embedding vectors to help users find the right articles. The using natural language queries on the web application, the articles with the highest score have shown to the users.
